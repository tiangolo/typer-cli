# Typer CLI

‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) instead of [Typer CLI](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer-cli).

---

All the functionality in this repo for [`typer-cli`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer-cli), has been integrated into [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer).

The main repo, https://github.com/tiangolo/typer, publishes a PyPI package `typer-cli` (that used to be this repo), and that PyPI package does nothing other than depend on `typer`.

All the functionality has been integrated into `typer`.

Install instead `typer`:

```bash
pip install typer
```

That includes the `typer` command.

This repo is now deprecated and archived. ü§ì
